# Amarrons

A map web-mobile application to navigate the waterways and see the mooring points.

[The web app](https://amarrons.com)

The backend is in TypeScript with the Framework [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and the ORM [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/)

For the frontend, [Ionic React](https://ionicframework.com/react) is used and [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) to manage the map

It was an opportunity for me to dive more into backend (I'm a frontend dev in my job), to play with maps (it's one of my passions along with history) and to test React more deeply (I'm a fan of Angular), all this to give a serious project that I like
